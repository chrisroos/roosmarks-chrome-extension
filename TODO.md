* Can I avoid the 404 warnings in the background.js console if a bookmark doesn't exist for the given URL?

* Display the new bookmark form if the request to roosmarks returns a 404

* Use a HEAD request, rather than GET, to determine the presence of a bookmark

* Allow the roosmarks server to be configured so that it's easy to swap between development/production
